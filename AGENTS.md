## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues on `bholmesdev/hubble.md` via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Defaults: `needs-triage`, `ready-to-implement`, `needs-discussion`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context — `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Review readiness

Use `.agents/skills/review-readiness` before handing code to a human reviewer.
