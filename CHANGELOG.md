# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to Hubble. Entries are written as work lands
(see the `changelog` skill), then harvested into the desktop release notes.

Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Open the current note in Codex or Claude from the note actions menu, with the workspace and note path already filled in. [#188](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/188)
- Browse every workspace file, edit plain text and code, view PDFs and images in Hubble, and open any file in its default app. Thanks [@zcuric](https://github.com/zcuric) for the suggestion! [#183](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/183)
- Hubble now collects anonymous usage data to help improve the app, with a clear notice and a Settings toggle to opt out. See [TELEMETRY.md](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/blob/main/TELEMETRY.md) for what's collected. [#182](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/182)
- Leave review comments on a note: highlight text to start a thread, reply to it, and resolve it when it's handled. Comments live in the Markdown itself, so they travel with the file. Thanks [@hwong103](https://github.com/hwong103)! [#175](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/175)
- Browse every comment in a note from the toolbar, filter by unresolved or resolved, and copy a prompt handing the open threads to your agent. For the best results, install the [review-markdown-comments skill](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble-skills/blob/main/skills/review-markdown-comments/SKILL.md) with `npx skills add bholmesdev/hubble-skills --skill review-markdown-comments`, so your agent knows how to reply and resolve them. Thanks [@hwong103](https://github.com/hwong103)! [#175](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/175)
